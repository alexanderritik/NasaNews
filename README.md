          explanation: "Newly discovered Comet SWAN has already developed an impressive tail. The comet came in from the outer           Solar System and has just passed inside the orbit of the Earth. Officially designated C/2020 F8 (SWAN), this                   outgassing interplanetary iceberg will pass its closest to the Earth on May 13, and closest to the Sun on May 27.             The comet was first noticed in late March by an astronomy enthusiast looking through images taken by NASA's Sun-               orbiting SOHO spacecraft, and is named for this spacecraft's Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) camera. The featured               image, taken from the dark skies in Namibia in mid-April, captured Comet SWAN's green-glowing coma and unexpectedly           long, detailed, and blue ion-tail. Although the brightness of comets are notoriously hard to predict, some models             have Comet SWAN becoming bright enough to see with the unaided eye during June. Experts Debate: How will humanity             first discover extraterrestrial life?",
